# MRIP
This repository holds my ongoing work using data from the [MRIP program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/recreational-fishing-data/recreational-fishing-data-downloads). This includes:

- An adaptation of the MRIP template programs to estimate catch and directed angler trips
- Work calculating catch by zipcode
- Code to download the most current version of the MRIP data
