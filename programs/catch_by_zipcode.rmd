This document will adapt David Carter's code to generate catch by zipcode estimates from the MRIP data. The provided script does not run with current libraries in this project.

First, loading the libraries:

```{r}
library(stringr)
library(survey)
options(survey.lonely.psu="certainty")
```

Then loading the MRIP data provided by David, which also came with the following comments:

```
#trips: Wave 6 private boat trips to Florida
#catch: Wave 6 private boat trips to West Florida that caught (A+B1+B2) gag
```

```{r}
trips=readRDS("../data/clean_data/trips.rds")
catch=readRDS("../data/clean_data/catch.rds")
```

```{r}
2+2
```
